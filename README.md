## To-do

* [ ] Ensure windows are never cut off from screen (cross-platform)
* [ ] Move polygon implementation to matplotlib
* [ ] Create Attributes Enum
* [ ] Create Plot enum
* [ ] Being testing on Mac OS
* [ ] Pull data from selected shapes

## Big Ideas:

* [ ] Draw shape of object on sidebar when clicking on selection for db
* [ ] Move database to MySQL and get away from sqlite
* [ ] Start integrating testing?
* [ ] Radial Shapes

## Notes: 

Database finite limit could be extended with pagination, splitting the database into 'pages' that the user would need to go through. But this also introduces the fact that searching would need to pull all pages for an ample search

Py2exe can be used for building an executable, but research will need to be done into developing a setup file.
