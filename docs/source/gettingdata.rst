Getting the Data
================

Data collected by the CALIPSO satellite is free to the public, all it takes is going through a couple
of steps to order the data. **eosweb** is the primary distributor for the satellite, you can find their
webpage `here`__ and order data from `here`__

Once at the order page, you can be redirected to the reverb search tool for grabbing data from the specific
data you want. The most common data you can visualize with vocal would be Standard Level 1 datafile, those
can be queried by entered "CAL_LID_L1-Standard" in the *search terms* window and selecting a date range of
your choice. Once ordered processing can take up to a couple days, so be patient!

Another option is to grab example data from ccplot's sourceforge page, which a simple CALIPSO data file you
can easily download and load into VOCAL right off the bat:

* `CAL_LID_L1-ValStage1-V3-01.2007-06-12T03-42-18ZN.hdf`_
