Getting Started Developing
==========================

Before writing your first line of code in VOCAL, give the user and developer documentation a read
through!

--------------
Learn the Code
--------------

Make sure your python skills are up to date. Check out the `Code Academy`__ website for an interactive
python tutorial. Refer to the `python 2.7 documentation`__ for help with specific commands. VOCAL is
based heavily on Tk/Tkinter. Documetaion and examples can be found on a multitude of sites, but
`Effbot`__ has some good examples and explanations. Finally, check out the GitHub to see VOCAL's
`repository`__. Try looking through the code to get a feeling for the flow and organization of the
program before you start making additions.

------------
Get in Touch
------------

Many DEVELOPers have put their hands on VOCAL's code and can provide you with some great insight into
how the program is structured and what challenges they faced. Join the Slack or just send an email
to one of the previous project leads.

-------
Use Git
-------

Before you start making changes, learn how to use Git for version control. GitHub provides an
`interactive tutorial`__ on using Git, but there a resources all over the web. For VOCAL, we stick
to several best practices in order to streamline development. If you plan on developing VOCAL, you
**must** use Git.
